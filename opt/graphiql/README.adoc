== Troubleshooting

=== Emacs and the webpack dev server

When developing the GraphiQL console with Emacs, `yarn start` exits with an error when it sees an Emacs lockfile. The workaround is to edit watchOptions in node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpackDevServer.config.js to the following

[source]
----
watchOptions: {
  ignored: [ignoredFiles(paths.appSrc), '**/.#*', '**/*~', '**/#*#'],
},
----

You can also disable lockfiles for this directory with a .dirlocals containing

[source]
----
((nil . ((create-lockfiles . nil))))
----

This means you don't have to mess with node modules which will probably cause some issues
