= Namespaces ahead

What are these?

WARNING: Terrible puns and word-plays ahead.

* site -- all the stuff that holds this project together. The main entrance to the rabbit hole.

* apex -- anything to do with OpenAPI -- apex means APi EXecution.

* dave -- anything to do with WebDav -- dave is 'DAV' plus 'Extensions' (an excuse to include the name 'Dave' in a project).

* grab -- anything to do with GraphQL.

* pass -- authentication, authorization -- as in, "You Shall Not Pass!!!" (Site
  attempts to protect resources from Balrogs)

* spin -- extras that are related to spin, as in, a spider 'spins' its web. Spin is a dependency library declared in deps.edn.
